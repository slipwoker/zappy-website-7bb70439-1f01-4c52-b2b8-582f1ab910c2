  "about_p_15": "Happily created by&nbsp;Zappy",
  "about_p_16": "OFFSCRIPT EVENTS was born from a real need we identified in the Israeli event planning market. Time and again we saw clients who invested large sums of money in events, only to discover that the final result didn't match their expectations. The main problem was simple yet complex - people couldn't see their event before it happened.",
  "about_p_17": "We decided to change this situation. We developed an event planning platform in Israel that combines advanced visual visualization technology with a comprehensive database of event vendors and locations. Our goal was clear - to enable every person to see exactly how their event will look, even before they commit financially.",
  "about_p_18": "The journey wasn't easy. We built a team of developers, designers and event experts who worked together to create a tool that is both technological and user-friendly. We invested years in research and development, tested dozens of different technologies, and collaborated with hundreds of vendors and locations across the country.",
  "about_p_19": "Today, OFFSCRIPT EVENTS is the leading event planning platform in Israel. We serve thousands of clients every year, connect event planners with leading vendors, and help turn dreams into reality. Our visual event visualization has become a new industry standard, and we're proud to lead this revolution.",

  "about_p_27": "Our system learns from every event planned through the platform. It analyzes preferences, identifies patterns, and offers personalized recommendations for each client. The more people use the platform, the smarter and more efficient it becomes.",
  "about_p_28": "But our technology isn't just about code and algorithms. We've also invested in building a massive database of event locations, vendors, design styles and more. All this data allows us to offer our clients the best options, tailored exactly to their needs.",
